        "to extract information from different spatial sizes.\n",

        "to reduce the number of channels, reducing the model's complexity.\n",
        "The fourth path uses a $3\\times 3$ maximum pooling layer,\n",

        "\n",
        "* The Inception block is equivalent to a subnetwork with four paths. It extracts information in parallel through convolutional layers of different window shapes and maximum pooling layers. $1 \\times 1$ convolutions reduce channel dimensionality on a per-pixel level. Maximum pooling reduces the resolution.\n",
        "* GoogLeNet connects multiple well-designed Inception blocks with other layers in series. The ratio of the number of channels assigned in the Inception block is obtained through a large number of experiments on the ImageNet dataset.\n",
